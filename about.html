        <section id="banner">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>General Services Agency has an annual business volume of over $500 million, manages over 105 thousand fleet vehicles, and manages a building portfolio, which includes 1,011 owned or leased assets, more than 178 million rentable square feet of workspace, and 271 historic properties. We have a continuing commitment to our local customers and the Liberian public to provide services in the most cost-effective manner possible, and we deliver on this promise by steadily improving organizational performance. At a time when budgets are shrinking across the local government, we are providing the value that our partner agencies need so that they can focus their resources on fulfilling their own important missions to the Liberian people.</p>
            <h2>Strategic Goals & Objectives</h2>
            <p>Agencies establish a variety of organizational goals to drive progress toward key outcomes for the Liberian people. Long-term strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission and address relevant national problems, needs, challenges and opportunities. Strategic objectives define the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve, and also include the agency's role. Each strategic objective is tracked through a suite of performance goals, indicators and other evidence.</p><br><br>
            <strong>Statement:</strong>General Services Agency will effectively leverage the government’s buying power to reduce costs.<br><br>
            <strong>Description:</strong>General Services Agency will effectively leverage existing, and develop new, local strategic sourcing initiatives to provide competitively priced solutions to drive savings in technology, real property and other acquisitions throughout the local government. Through these solutions, GSA will be able to leverage governmentwide business volume for better pricing, and standardize contracting terms and conditions in order to reduce the cost of purchasing across government.<br><br>

            <strong>Description:</strong><p>By September 30, 2019, GSA will save $255 million ($111 million during FY 2017 and $144 million during FY 2018) through the use of Local Strategic Sourcing Initiative (LSSI). Local agencies purchase over $500M of goods and services annually. A key vehicle used by GSA, and other top purchasing Local government agencies, to promote cost savings, improved management visibility and adoption of best practices, has been the local Strategic Sourcing Initiative. Established in 2014, LSSI is designed to improve government management of commonly purchased goods and services. LSSI provides customers with significant savings, decreases administrative redundancy, and improves business intelligence while meeting or exceeding small business and sustainability goals.</p><br><br>
            <strong>Description:</strong><p>General Services Agency is leading efforts to improve asset utilization, reduce agency space requirements, effectively manage real property, and pursue innovative proposals to leverage resources. We are a government-wide leader and expert in real estate solutions. We will assist and educate federal departments and agencies to develop plans that will assist agencies with consolidating their space to reduce their footprint.
                General Services Agency is encouraging agencies to reduce space to minimize costs. We use a variety of tools, strategies, and portfolio planning options to determine the optimal housing solutions for agencies. We are also targeting our large, more costly new construction, major repairs and alterations, and leasing prospectus projects. By working with customer agencies, GSA will identify opportunities to optimize local real estate portfolios by reducing space, improving utilization, disposing of underutilized assets, and leveraging market opportunities to reduce the footprint and investment and operating costs.
                General Services Agency supports the Office of Management and Budget’s “Freeze the Footprint” policy – aimed at maintaining government-wide square footage for offices and warehouses – by collecting government-wide data and conducting analysis to assess the performance of each agency towards meeting the national goal.</p><br><br>
                <strong>Strategies:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use of the Customer Portfolio Plans process to develop and implement space saving opportunities with demonstrated value for both the client and GSA. These plans create value by proposing solutions which align Administration, Client Agency and GSA goals, and help optimize an agency’s existing portfolio while more effectively anticipating, capturing, and advising on future portfolio needs.</li>
                    <li>Where it is advantageous to the local government, work to house tenants in locally owned space, rather than leasing from the private sector.</li>
                    <li>Minimize the amount of vacant space in the inventory and increase the utilization of existing space.</li>
                </ol><br><br>

                    <strong>Description:</strong>
                    <p>GSA achieved mixed results in meeting its financial performance goals for improving organizational efficiency. GSA achieved a total of $190 million savings in indirect costs from the FY 2010 baseline, far exceeding its goal of $155 million. However, GSA did not meets its target to improve operational efficiency to reduce GSA operating costs to 9.4 percent of revenue from goods and services provided.  The primary reason for not meeting the target is due to the lower than expected revenue from goods and services provided.  GSA  savings are being realized through consolidation and realignment of key support functions and organizations, and by reviewing, improving and standardizing internal processes and controls.  Three efficiency initiatives of note include data center consolidation, the print management program, and consolidation of GSA’s information technology, human resources, administrative, and financial functions.</p><br><br>
                    <p>GSA is consolidating its data centers to increase efficiency through economies of scale.  GSA recently eliminated and/or re-purposed 12,000 square feet of floor space, decommissioned over 230 servers, and moved over 200 servers to other data centers.  By the end of FY2015, GSA projects a net five years savings of $24 million.</p><br><br>
                    <p>GSA also reduced its inventory of printers to increase resource efficiency from 5 to 25 employees per printer. GSA has also developed seven Print-Wise tips to guide employees to make cost-cutting print decisions.  Wide spread adoption of Print-Wise behaviors by other agencies, such as double-sided printing, can save the government hundreds of millions of dollars annually.</p><br><br>
                    <p>GSA determined from a top-to-bottom review that the best way to build a stronger GSA would be to consolidate the IT, HR, administrative, and financial functions of GSA.  By consolidating each of these administrative functions, GSA will improve efficiency with greater clarity around responsibility and accountability.  In the past year, GSA has completed consolidation of each of the four functions.  Each functional organization is going through realignment to ensure the most efficient use of resources to fully meet their area of responsibility.</p><br><br>
                    <p>GSA has significantly improved the on-time activation of occupancy agreements (OAs) in owned space to 98 percent and leased space to 90 percent.  This is a substantial improvement from the on-time activation rates of  86 percent for owned space and 75 percent for leased space.  At the same time, GSA is having considerable success supporting agencies in their efforts to consolidate their footprints and implement more cost effective workplace solutions.  In part as a result of these consolidation actions, which in some cases lead to vacant leased space that GSA is obligated to continue to pay for, GSA faces challenges achieving full cost recovery in the leasing program.</p><br><br>
                    <p>GSA exceeded its cycle time goals for real property disposal services.  GSA continued to effectively award public sales properties within 135 days. GSA also exceeded its performance target for non-competitive sales and donations within 220 days. GSA continues to efficiently provide training courses through the Federal Acquisition Institute with course attendance levels consistently exceeding 80 percent.</p><br><br>
                    <strong>Description:</strong>
                    <p>GSA will continue to invest in improving our real property assets and operating systems to meet the needs of its federal customers. We will use asset evaluation tools to determine the financial performance in the real property inventory. By applying leading and innovative building operations management principles, we will provide services in an efficient and effective manner for the American taxpayer.</p><br><br>
                    <p>GSA will continue to support customers in meeting their fleet needs though the efficient management of our fleet operations. Since we are responsible for approximately one half of the federal fleet, we leverage economies of scale in delivering fleet solutions to customers that include working with customers to find the best solutions to meet their mission critical needs at the lowest cost possible. We are also able to manage changes in demand from customers through use of its vehicles to alleviate the need for additional assets by the federal government to meet short term needs.</p><br><br>
                    <strong>Strategies:</strong><br><br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Maintain a viable, self-sustaining inventory of real properties providing federal agencies with optimum facilities at the best possible cost.</li>
                        <li>Ensure customer agencies are paying competitive, market rates for building support services.</li>
                        <li>Actively manage the GSA Fleet vehicles across the federal customer base and maximize asset utilization to the greatest extent possible.</li>
                        <li>Leverage the information systems and infrastructure across the federal government to reduce per unit cost of vehicle operations.</li>
                        <li>Work with our customer agencies to further educate them on how to efficiently identify and dispose of unneeded real property assets.</li>
                    </ol>

We will also assess our performance in acquisition, technology, and real property services through annual surveys to attain customer perceptions concerning the quality, reliability, value, timeliness, and responsiveness of GSA in meeting federal agency needs. Customer data will be used to drive continuous improvement.
                        We will continue to improve relationships with current and potential suppliers, and develop tools and processes to make it easier for suppliers to efficiently meet the needs of government customers. We will analyze market and vendor data to negotiate better rates, discounts, improved services and other benefits for federal agencies. We will increase vendor outreach and communications to strengthen trust with suppliers.
                        GSA will enhance federal government interaction with the American public by providing innovative tools and solutions that better enable the American public to access federal information; increasing federal use of existing public engagement tools, technology, and expertise; improving access and increasing the American public’s use of communication mediums aimed at public engagement.</p>
